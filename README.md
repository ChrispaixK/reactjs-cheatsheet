> This repository contains notes on React JS that I am using as a reference while I am learning the framework. The notes include explanations of React concepts, code snippets, and examples of how to use different features of React.

**Note:** This is a new repository, and not all content is available yet. I'm working on adding more notes as I learn more about React.js, so stay tuned!
